# CombiOptimRLlib

Combinatorial Optimization with RLib such as the HPC Scheduling problem. I will include other Combinatorial Optimization Problem / Solution

Some teams develop promising RL proof-of-concept, but codes are not available and experiences hard to reproduce, with sometimes methodological pitfals (the exact same scenario is repeated in training/evaluation).

Therefore I do my own implementation.

See Notebooks (.ipynb files).
